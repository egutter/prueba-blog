Nowadays, more applications are RIA oriented solutions. RIA (Rich Internet Applications) is a new kind of application with more advantages than traditional applications. It emerges as a combination of features offered by web applications and desktop applications. Even multimedia capabilities are covered because these environments have internal players.

RIA is a new concept that is growing with the advent of Adobe's product Flex, Flash, OpenLaszlo and the Ajax platform.

The goal of this presentation is to show by example the way to integrate a pure Smalltalk back-end with a flexible front-end made it with Flex, using web services. In this way we:

* Obtain Smalltalk capabilities to model my business domain
* Give my application a rich and appealing interface in short time, with many problems already solved.

With this integration we look for best domain modeling techniques with Smalltalk, as reflective capabilities, dynamic typing and, in the other hand, to get the best communicative interface as RIA.

Finally, integrating in this manner is a perfect complement when developing applications not only web but desktop too, because you give the final product a unique dynamism thank to Smalltalk and a rich, friendly and interactive interface as Flex (o more generally RIA).
