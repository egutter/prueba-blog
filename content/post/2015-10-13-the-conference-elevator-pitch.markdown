title: Tips for introducing yourself in a conference or 'the conference elevator pitch'

It could sounds basic, but when you talk with people in a conference, you have to think quickly. So it's very important to have in mind a successful path to a productive five-minutes chat. After being talking with a lot of people and making a lot of mistakes (since not knowing what to say about what our company do, to not asking how to contact him/her back); Iâ€™ve decided to write down a guidelines to introduce yourself and getting to know the other person, avoiding typical mistakes.

## Must-ask questions (and its must-remember answers)
It's important to talk, but sometimes it's more important and more difficult to listen. That's why I prefer to start talking about what you need to hear and know from the person in front of you:

- **What's her/his name?** Basic, but sometimes when you are in a rush, you forget this.
- **What does she/he do?** Again, basic. But a lot of times I've found myself speaking a lot about what I do in order to convince the other how great we are, that I forgot to know and understand what this guy does. And this is one of the most important things in order to identify how you can make synergy together.
- **How can you contact her/him back?** This is important so you can continue your conversation if a potential lead emerges from the talk.

Finally, it's not important to ask the questions like this or in this order; what it is really important is that at the end of the conversation you know these 3 things:

- you know his/her name,
- what his/her company do,
- and how you can contact him/her

## What do I need to tell from me?
It is really important also to let him/her know about you. And since you have a very short limited time, you have to choose very careful what do you want the other person to remember. So here it's the top 3 messages you should always send:

- **What is my name and the name of my company?** This is important so he/she can later connect your name or your company name with other things
- **What do I/we do?** It's important to be wide open, but not to much. So try to be special in something, but let space for match with the interests of your audition
- **With who?** Here I encourage to choose your top 3 clients. Not the most important for your company but the most well known.

## Template elevator pitch to introduce myself
So, saying this, and in order to have a training and think about this basic but important things, I create a template for sort of an elevator pitch to introduce yourself. Again, you could think this is worthless, but try doing it and you will discover that it's not so easy.

{% blockquote %}
My template elevator pitch to introduce myself


* My name is...
* My company does...
* We work with...


* My name is Jorge Silva, I work at 10Pines, a south america company based in Buenos Aires
* My company does great software for great companies
* Such as Starbucks, 8thLight and Teespring
{% endblockquote %}

So, now is your turn, tell me

- Who are you?
- What do you do?
- And how can I contact you?

That's it. Simple and straightforward.
Hope this is useful.
