OOSCM (Object Oriented Software Configuration Management) is a tool we are developing to better support traits that are unique to object oriented development. Current SCM tools (CVS,SVN,GIT,Monticello, etc) are file based solutions, the file is the minimum versionable element, but when developing with objects files are not the elements we manage, we manage and version classes, methods, packages, etc. OOSCM will keep the history of changes of these elements (from basic changes like modifying a method to composite one like renaming a class) providing at the same time means to treat products, baselines, projects, etc. as first class versionable elements with the objective of helping team development in all its steps (programming, integration, etc). The talk provides a description of the tool's objective, architecture and current development state.
