---

Patagonia is a conference registration web based system written in Pharo using Seaside, whose main purpose is to fulfill the ESUG conference registration needs. It was developed at 10Pines under the sponsorship of ESUG. It has been develop using some design principles that were "grown" developing other two systems, being Patagonia the latest version of them. These design principle's objective is the development of "robust" software, that is, software that can easily change in a safe fashion, being at the same time self defensive when used incorrectly and self "teachable" to new programmers of the system.
